Spidertron Engineer MK2 (BIG Edition)
==================

Are you tired of walking around on only 2 legs? Now you can live your whole life as a hulking 8-legged spider mech!

This is a forked version of Spidertron Engineer (by Xorimuth), which adds bigger spidertrons that can be unlocked through upgrades.
A major change is the custom science pack and the grand mother board. The grand motherboard is purple, and its used to make the custom science pack, which is very expensive. (Have fun automating spidertron prioduction) 

You can see Xterminator's Mod Spotlight here for the original version of the mod:

Major Features (Original mod)
-----

- Spawn from the start as a Spidertron (with no way to exit it!*)
- Starting Spidertron stats are adjusted to be comparable to a normal engineer
- Reworked military and armor research technologies to add weapons, armor, inventory and equipment grid slots to the Spidertron instead
    - For example, when the Modular Armor research is completed, 10 inventory slots, a small equipment grid, increased health and resistances, and physical size increases are applied directly to all players (thank you to [Qon](https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=16047) for the help with size scaling!)
- Optional space science rework (thank you to [Polsefel](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/ii5k95/altf4_2_spidertron/g34mf8l) for the suggestion)
    - Launch spidertrons into space instead of satellites to obtain space science packs (a spidertron does cost ~3x that of a satellite, but the difference is small compared to the total cost of all the rocket parts)
    - Reclaim fish from the rocket either directly or by converting space science into fish
- Optionally spawn with a spidertron remote configured to control your own Spidertron Engineer, allowing point-and-click movement
- Heal surrounding buildings by emitting a repair pack as a repair cloud
- Dependency on [Spidertron Enhancements](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SpidertronEnhancements) adds other QoL features such as Spidertron Engineer inventory items being sorted and *Shift + E* to open Spidertron Engineer inventory directly

*There is a setting that allows you to exit the Spidertron. This allows some features from other mods to work, such as entering a factory in [Factorissimo2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Factorissimo2)

Other mods EmperorKermit and I made:
- [Ãœber Drill](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/UberDrill/) This mod adds a mining drill that can be placed anywhere for infinite resources, however it needs a very strong acid to mine this deep and it will require coolant if Space Exploration is present.
